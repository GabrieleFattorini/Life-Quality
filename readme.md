## WebApp
<br>

This is a little web app for a Start2Impact project: a <b>form</b> created with html, css and javascript. <br><br>Here you can search for the name of a city and, using an api key, you will get the data on the quality of life in that specific place.

<br>

## Demo
<br>

Here is a working live demo: https://fattorini-lifequality.web.app

<br>

## Mockups
<br>

The web app is adapted for all devices, as can be seen in these mockups.
